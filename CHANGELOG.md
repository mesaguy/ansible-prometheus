   - redis_exporter_oliver006
- Add support for HAProxy metrics via socket using a new options:
   'prometheus_haproxy_exporter_socket'
- Add support for managing ~/.my.cnf file for mysqld_exporter

### Changed

- Upgrade Prometheus from v2.4.3 to v2.5.0
- Use 'get_url' to download each archive, 'unarchive' to extract each archive, and then 'file' for cleanup. Using 'unarchive' alone was too limiting as 'unarchive' doesn't support redirects and many of the other features of get_url

### Fixed

- Support command line arguments that contain double quotes (like the node_exporter example)
- kafka_exporter_danielqsj, pushgateway, rabbitmq_exporter_kbudde, and sql_exporter_free  make commands when building from source

## [0.6.0] - 2018-11-03

### Changed

- Upgrade Go from v1.11.1 to v1.11.2
- Upgrade squid_exporter_boynux from v1.2 to v1.4
- Configure tgroup files after an exporter is running instead of after the
   exporter is installed. This ensures Prometheus servers never poll exporters
   that haven't been started.

### Fixed

- Run tgroup file creation tasks serially
- Clarify boolean 'when:' checks in tasks, fixes cases where a text boolean
   is set

## [0.5.0] - 2018-10-25

### Added

- Add service 'reload' support to alertmanager and prometheus. Causes processes to reload configuration files without restarting processes
- Validate alertmanager and prometheus configuration files before starting services
- Optionally verify that the Prometheus server/s can reach each exporter service
- Optionally add iptables or firewalld firewall rules to permit Prometheus server/s to reach exporter/s
- Symlink amtool and promtool to /usr/local/bin
- Ability to manage tgroups via the client (push to server) or from the server based on hostvars

- Upgrade memcached_exporter from v0.4.1 to v0.5.0
- Upgrade pushgateway from v0.5.2 to v0.6.0
- Upgrade statsd_exporter from v0.7.0 to v0.8.0
- Systemd based processes now maintain a PID file. Useful for sending
   kill -HUP and other signals via scripts and consistent with OpenRC and
   upstart implementations
- Ubuntu on non-RHEL systems no longer starts software inside of a bash instance

### Fixed

- When building Prometheus software from source, prioritize this role's
   copy/version of Go over the system's copy/version of Go
- Formatting; indents and extra newlines; in OpenRC and upstart configs
- Software not run as 'root' or 'prometheus' may have been unable to write
   logs on upstart and OpenRC based systems. The log file is now created
   with the correct permissions ahead of starting the service
